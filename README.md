# Wordle in Elm

This is just a (exact) clone I'm making for fun. <br>
You can play the original one [here](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). <br>
And you can play mine [here](https://niccomaganeli.github.io/Wordelm/).

### Why am I doing this?
Recently I've been trying to improve my front-end skills due to my job position. So, I thought it would be a great challenge to try to replicate this game in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) and pure-CSS. Not using [elm-ui](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-ui/latest/) because (despite being great) I won't have it available at my job.


## Run locally

You must have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) installed and then run at project root the following command

```console
$ yarn dev
```

It will open a server at https://localhost:8000
